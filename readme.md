#Jobba: The Hunt

##Introduction

###About the Project
Jobba: The Hunt is a Full Stack (MEAN) web application inspired by classic RPG's of the 80's that gamifies the job hunting process.  It allows users to gain experience points and level up their characters as they follow tips and steps that help them to take a more holistic approach to job hunting.  (As opposed to spamming the internet with your resume.)
