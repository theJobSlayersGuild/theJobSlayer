# The Job Slayer (aka Jobba: The Hunt)

The job application process, gamified.

You find yourself in a room...

In the room is a pile of filthy straw, an old wooden bucket, and a few gnawed bones.

You have been imprisoned by the evil No Jobba. To escape the dungeon of Uhnimploid, you must equip yourself and slay his minions. This is…Jobba: The Hunt.

Or The Job Slayer. We haven't decided yet.
